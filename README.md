# Design Patterns in Java

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of six software design patterns in Java. The patterns are grouped into three categories: **Behavioral**, **Creational**, and **Structural**. Each pattern is illustrated with two different use cases to showcase the flexibility and power of these design techniques.

### Design Patterns Covered
1. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - Observer Pattern
   - Command Pattern
2. **Creational Patterns**
   - Singleton Pattern
   - Factory Pattern
3. **Structural Patterns**
   - Adapter Pattern
   - Facade Pattern

---


Each folder contains Java code demonstrating one of the patterns.

## Design Patterns Explanation

### 1. Behavioral Patterns
**a. Observer Pattern**  
In this example, we simulate a task notification system where multiple users (observers) get notified when a new task is added to the task manager (subject).

**b. Command Pattern**  
We implement a remote control system where each button on the remote represents a command (like turning a light on or off).

### 2. Creational Patterns
**a. Singleton Pattern**  
A Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the `ConfigurationManager` exists, allowing global access to a single configuration object.

**b. Factory Pattern**  
This example demonstrates a factory for creating different types of tasks (e.g., coding tasks and testing tasks) without specifying their exact class.

### 3. Structural Patterns
**a. Adapter Pattern**  
We implement an audio player that can play multiple file formats (mp3, mp4, and vlc) using an adapter to bridge incompatible interfaces.

**b. Facade Pattern**  
The Facade pattern is used to create a simple interface for controlling a home automation system (lights and air conditioning).
